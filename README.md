# Savenger Hunt, GitHub Pages (Hosting), and Creating Repositories

Scavenger hunt: how do personal networks work (desktop), and WANs (desktop to cloud)
- Where are GitHub Servers? Which countries and locations?
- How far does data travel with every saving of code?
- What would it mean to have a GitHub server in your home? (permissions and physical data updating)

# Five Mandatory Pieces of a Computer Environment for Android Apps
- Ensure you can see file extensions: View / [Checkbox] Show File Extensions
- Creating and Maintaining a GitHub Account
  - Creating a GitHub Repository, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Creating-a-GitHub-Repository">Click Here</a>
  - Using Markdown, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">Click Here</a>
  - Ideas for creating a presentation or video, <a herf="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects">Click Here, might not work</a>
  - Ensure your email is working and protected, "Have I Been Pwned?", "Badrap": this is now a legal and recorded form of communication for everything online
- Creating and Maintaining a LinkedIn Account, connecting to others (must be at least 16 years old), see the website and start a profile (students will focus on )
- Downloading and Inflating Processing on the parent folder of the C-Drive (Mr. Mercer will help with this)
  - Here: https://processing.org/
- Downloading and Installing Atom.io, here, https://atom.io/
- Downloading and Installing GitHub Desktop (i.e. version control software), https://desktop.github.com/

Assignments: introduce GitHub, version control software (and file pathways for prototyping), integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")
1. Create a LinkedIn Account and share with Mr. Mercer and others in the class as profile is developed
2. Create a new repository, share it with Mr. Mercer by email (email URL), and modify the ReadMe.md file with Case Study ideas
   - OPTION: use GitHub Classroom
   - NOTE: you should take some time and explore GitHub Classroom (lots of free stuff to explore)
3. Create new repositories for each of the Case Studies listed below ... Remeber [PROJECT NAME].github.io ... then Pages / Main Branch / Save ... then record Live URL

What these prompts should illustrate
- how code will read like a book, probably paragraph
- how drawing occurs on a coordinate plane but is controlled by "paperfolding"
- the importance of paper folding and Case Studies in GUI Design

# Where Files Live: Cloud or Local

Note about Pathways and URL's (Internet HTTP & HTTPS): all students will become familiar with ways of noting "Where does my file live?"
- **Reading Hint**: notice the difference between `/` & `\`
- Pathway Exemplar: `C:\Users\mmercer\Documents\GitHub\Hello-World\exemplarHelloWorld`
- URL Exemplar: https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Hello-World
- Instructions: File / Save

# Beginning Activity: How do you save to the Cloud
- Note: using Command Line and associated tools will occur in CS-20

Scavenger hunt: how do personal networks work (desktop), and WANs (desktop to cloud)
- Where are GitHub Servers? Which countries and locations?
- How far does data travel with every saving of code?
- What would it mean to have a GitHub server in your home? (permissions and physical data updating)

### Create the Following Repositories

Website Case Studies and Creating GitHub Repositories
("How do you convince another person, by reading a single page, your digital identity or app created is worth reading or using further?")

Choose one of the following Projects
- "Who Am I" Website Project, <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Who-Am-I">Click Here</a>
- Promotion of Android App: Drawing Program or Music Program

Create a Repository for one of the projects previous listed
- PROJECT_NAME github.io
- Settings / GitHub Pages / Change Source to Main & Save

Create another Repository for Learning HTML (a website to learn how to build a website)
- Learning HTML github.io
- Settings / GitHub Pages / Change Source to Main & Save

Any additional notes you have should be entered into the ReadMe.md file through Atom.io using <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">GitHub Markdown</a>

Note: in Intermediate CS Mr. Mercer will review Command Lines and Accoisated tools used for locating specific servers and pathways. Instruction may also include ...
- Home-based servers (LAMP) for mirroring a website locally on a RPi
