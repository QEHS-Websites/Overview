  - Ideas for creating a presentation or video, <a herf="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Introductory%20Presentation%20Guidance"></a>
- Creating and Maintaining a LinkedIn Account, connecting to others (must be at least 16 years old), see the website and start a profile (students will focus on )
- Downloading and Stalling Chrome, Here: <A href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>
- Downloading and Installing Atom.io, here, https://atom.io/
- Downloading and Installing GitHub Desktop (i.e. version control software), https://desktop.github.com/

Assignments: introduce GitHub, version control software (and file pathways for prototyping), integrating App Development with Websites and Promotion ("Where do files live?")
1. Create a LinkedIn Account and share with Mr. Mercer and others in the class as profile is developed
2. Create a new repository, share it with Mr. Mercer by email (email URL), and modify the ReadMe.md file with Case Study ideas
   - OPTION: use GitHub Classroom
   - NOTE: you should take some time and explore GitHub Classroom (lots of free stuff to explore)
3. Create new repositories for each of the Case Studies listed below

## Introductory CS Progressions and Assignments

Scavenger hunt: how do personal networks work (desktop), and WANs (desktop to cloud)
- Where are GitHub Servers? Which countries and locations?
- How far does data travel with every saving of code?
- What would it mean to have a GitHub server in your home? (permissions and physical data updating)

### Introductory CS Case Studies

*IMPORTANT*: You should have 9 repositories started in GitHub & GitHub Desktop

Main Project, Android App, review what is possible with Ketai.org
- "Design a cell phone app for your main project" that will first run as a fullScreen() computer app
- GUI
- List Behaviors and expectations
- List data you will need to code
- What will your touch screen and physical buttons be doing
- List the other interactions this app will have and when these will be available (clean & minimal GUI)

Website Case Studies ("How do you convince another person, by reading a single page, your digital identity or app created is worth reading or using further?")
- "Who Am I" Website Project, <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/Who-Am-I">Click Here</a>
- Promotion of Android App: Drawing Program or Music Program

Note for Android Assignments: the following must be drawn "exactly" in a case study (i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc.), then appear in canvas "exactly"

Additional Case Studies, in App Development
- *Note about submitting Case Studies*:
  - submit an image of paper and save this into the Repository made for the Project
  - export file from program, to be saved in Repository (i.e. MS Paint's .bitmap)
- Any additional notes you have should be entered into the ReadMe.md file through Atom.io using <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation">GitHub Markdown</a>
1. Hello World & Simple Counting (using formulae)
2. Composite Images (Snow Globe, Measles, etc.)
3. 3 by 3 Assignment including random colour with additional text, and images
4. Drawing Program (including background song and sound effects using mouse)
5. Music Program (including sound effects using key board and mouse)
6. Final Project: using Ketai Library
